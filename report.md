# High Issues

## H-1: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/SlitherCheck.sol [Line: 8](src/SlitherCheck.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber, address toCall) public {
	```

</details>



## H-2: Reentrancy: State change after external call

Changing state after an external call can lead to re-entrancy attacks.Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid this issue.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/SlitherCheck.sol [Line: 9](src/SlitherCheck.sol#L9)

	State is changed at: `number = newNumber`
	```solidity
	        (bool success, ) = toCall.call{value: 0}("");
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/SlitherCheck.sol [Line: 8](src/SlitherCheck.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber, address toCall) public {
	```

</details>



## L-2: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/SlitherCheck.sol [Line: 8](src/SlitherCheck.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber, address toCall) public {
	```
